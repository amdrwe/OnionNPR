This is a really basic project at this point.

NPR works really nicely because the NPR RSS feed works, so it parses very easily (we only need the titles for this so that's what we grab)

The way I have it set up right now feels really hacky and is probably not done very well, but it feels even worse for the headlines from the Onion.

Because the Onion's RSS feed doesn't work, it was a lot trickier.

As for how the program works:
It runs through System.in and System.out so it's a very standard text based thing.


Future plans:
Maybe add GUI
