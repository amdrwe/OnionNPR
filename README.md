Inspired by a post in a SA thread. Try to tell if a given headline is from the Onion or from NPR

This is really hacky and basic right now.

Game runs in CLI, menus are programmed very poorly so they will break if you do silly things.

Parsing the Onion headlines is done the way it is because the Onion's RSS feed does not have any content.

Unfortunately, I don't have a good way to remove sports news or the "American Voices" articles from the Onion side of things. I think I can do it but it'll take a little more work on my end.
